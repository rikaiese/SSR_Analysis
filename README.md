Mononucleotide SSR Analysis and Phylogenetic Clustering
This repository contains two scripts for analyzing mononucleotide Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) from DNA sequences in a FASTA file. The first script counts SSRs and calculates their percentages, while the second script performs phylogenetic clustering based on the SSR data.

Scripts Overview
1. First_Script_Count_SSR_commented.py
Description
This Python script counts mononucleotide SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats) in a DNA sequence and calculates their percentages relative to the sequence length.

Dependencies
argparse
BioPython (Bio)
pandas
Usage:
python First_Script_Count_SSR_commented.py <fasta_file> <min_length> <max_length>

Arguments
<fasta_file>: The input FASTA file containing DNA sequences.
<min_length>: The minimum SSR length to consider.
<max_length>: The maximum SSR length to consider.
Outputs
counts_output.csv: CSV file containing the count of each SSR.
percentages_output.csv: CSV file containing the percentage of each SSR.
2. Second_Script_Phylogeny_SSR_commented.R
Description
This R script performs PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and phylogenetic clustering on SSR data generated by the Python script. The phylogenetic clustering is bootstrapped and visualized as a phylogenetic tree.

Dependencies
ggplot2
pvclust
ape
Usage
Ensure the following input files are available:

percentages_output.csv: Generated by First_Script_Count_SSR_commented.py.
Classes.txt: A tab-separated file containing class labels for samples.
Run the R script in R or RStudio:

source("Second_Script_Phylogeny_SSR_commented.R")

Outputs
PCA_SSR_Labels.pdf: PCA plot colored by sample labels.
PCA_SSR_Classes.pdf: PCA plot colored by sample classes.
Distance_SSR.xls: Excel file containing the SSR distance matrix.
Bootstrap_HC_ALL.nwk: Newick file representing the phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values.
Example Workflow
Count SSRs and Calculate Percentages:
python First_Script_Count_SSR_commented.py input.fasta 3 6

This generates counts_output.csv and percentages_output.csv.
Phylogenetic Clustering and Visualization:
Prepare Classes.txt with the appropriate labels and run the R script:
source("Second_Script_Phylogeny_SSR_commented.R")

Please note that some values for the graphical representations in the R code are hard-coded,  you may want to change them manually.
